# ChatGPT Clone (Not Really) 

I built a small demo how to simulate a ChatGPT like interface. I built this demo using Spring Boot + Spring AI + HTMX & Tailwind. 

## Running the example

To run the example you will need to add your Open API Key 

```properties
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

And then run the application from your IDE or by running the following command: 

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run 
```
